# Next steps

## Update package.json

You may want to add to your package json the properties:

- repository
- bugs
- homepage
- keywords

## Services to add

It's time to add free services essential to keeping the quality of our library/project:

- Travis - CI
- Greenkeeper - Up to date dependencies
- Coveralls - Test coverage
- Snyk - Dependencies vulnerabilities
- Code climate - Code quality
- Sonarcloud - Bugs, Quality, Security of your code
- Codacy - Automated code reviews
- Fossa - License checker

## Documentation

If your library or project is extensive and your Readme is not enough, you may like to use something like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or [Git Book](https://docs.gitbook.com/).

Use GitHub pages will be great to have your documentation or page site in the same place than your code for free.

## Real Device/Browser testing

If your library is aiming the frontend and you would like to automate the tests of your supported device matrix, you can use the free version for open source projects of:
- [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source)
- [Testingbot](https://testingbot.com/open-source)

## Typing

In case you want to your JS with a stronger typing architecture, you may be interested in using [Flow](https://flow.org/) or [TypesScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org).

Also, you can keep your code with plain javascript but create [declaration files](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) for the TypeScript community.

## Tree shaking or UMD

In case you want to use the bundle in the browser directly [not recommended] or your library is targeting the frontend (and prepare it for tree shaking) you may want to use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en).
